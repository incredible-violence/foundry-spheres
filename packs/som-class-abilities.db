{"_id":"UC8yDWOdUYDDz5Bb","name":"Transfigurative Construction","permission":{"default":0,"55oRMeK8J5d3pvei":3},"type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>By studying ancient magic and crafting techniques, the armiger learns to customize his arsenal in more fantastic and unusual ways. The armiger gains the ability to apply modifications to his customized weapons. Applying a modification can be done in the same time it takes the armiger to customize a weapon, and each customized weapon can only have one modification applied to it at any given time. The armiger can apply any modification he meets the minimum level for. A modification applied to a custom weapon with the double weapon quality applies to both ends. The armiger must have the customized weapons class feature to gain this prowess.</p>\n<p>The armiger can select from the following initial modifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flexible Materials:</strong> The customized weapon gains the trip weapon special feature and grants a +2 circumstance bonus on disarm combat maneuvers made using the weapon.</li>\n<li><strong>Grapnel Attachment:</strong> The armiger customizes his weapon to fire a built-in grappling hook. The grappling hook is attached to a 30-foot-long chain. The armiger can attack with the grappling hook as a special attack action, making a ranged touch attack against the target. On a successful hit, the grappling hook deals no damage, but functions as though it had the grapple weapon special feature, except it requires only a hit (not a critical hit). The grapple ends if the armiger moves more than 30 feet away from the grappled creature. The customized weapon cannot be used to make attacks until the grappling hook has been reloaded (as a standard action). The length of the chain increases by 5 feet at level 5, and every 5 thereafter, and the armiger increases the maximum distance he can stand from the grappled target by the same amount.</li>\n<li><strong>Lethality Repurposing:</strong> The customized weapon can be used to deal lethal or nonlethal damage without taking a penalty on your attack roll.</li>\n<li><strong>Odd Curves and Edges:</strong> Choose bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The customized weapon deals the chosen damage type in addition to any damage types it normally deals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At 6th level, the armiger gains access to the following modifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Aerodynamic:</strong> The customized weapon may be thrown easily despite its shape. The customized weapon gains a range increment of 10 feet and can be thrown up to 5 range increments. If the customized weapon already has a range increment, instead increase the weapon&#8217;s range increment by 10 feet instead. This modification can only be applied to melee weapons.</li>\n<li><strong>Extending Framework:</strong> The customized weapon can extend or retract to be wielded at ranges normal weapons couldn&#8217;t. As a swift action, the armiger can extend or retract the customized weapon. When a customized weapon is extended, it gains the reach quality. When a customized weapon is retracted, it loses the reach quality. For example, an armiger adds the extending framework modification to a customized weapon lance, which allows him to retract his lance and remove the reach quality, and can then extend the customized weapon lance to restore the reach quality.</li>\n<li><strong>Shielding:</strong> You treat the customized weapon as a buckler, gaining a +1 shield bonus to AC as normal for a buckler. You lose this bonus (and stop treating the customized weapon as a buckler until the start of your next turn) if you attack with the weapon or wield another weapon in the same hand, unless you possess an ability to retain your shield bonus when making a shield bash attack, such as the Shield sphere Bashing Shield talent or the Improved Shield Bash feat. Making an attack with this weapon may count as making a shield bash if beneficial. When making a shield bash with the customized weapon, reduce the damage as if the shield bash was one size smaller.</li>\n<li><strong>Weightless:</strong> The customized weapon is unusually light, and can be wielded with greater precision than normal. The weapon is treated as a light melee weapon when determining whether it can be used with Weapon Finesse, as well as with any feat, spell, or special weapon ability that can be used in conjunction with light weapons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At 12th level, the armiger gains access to the following modifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dense Weighting:</strong> The customized weapon is treated as an appropriate weapon for sundering any type of object. Whenever a creature is hit by a customized weapon with this modification, they take a -2 penalty to their CMD against bull rush, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers until the end of its next turn or until after the creature is subject to a maneuver (whichever comes first). This penalty does not stack with itself.</li>\n<li><strong>Liquimetal Blanch:</strong> The customized weapon&#8217;s surface shimmers and shifts, almost like liquid. Each round, the first time the customized weapon would deal damage to a creature that has material- based damage reduction, the customized weapon bypasses that damage-reduction as if made from that material until the beginning of your next turn. For example, the armiger strikes a creature with DR/silver with his customized weapon longsword with this modification. The weapon immediately hardens to be treated as silver until the end of the round. If the armiger would make an attack of opportunity against a creature with DR/cold iron during that same round, the customized weapon would not change to cold iron. This does not affect the weapon&#8217;s normal ability to bypass material-based damage reduction. A cold iron longsword with this modification will always bypass cold iron.</li>\n<li><strong>Parrying Edge:</strong> The customized weapon is easier for the armiger to block attacks with. When you fight defensively or use Combat Expertise while wielding the customized weapon, your AC bonus increases by 1. In addition, attacks of opportunity made with the customized weapon deal an additional amount of damage equal to your practitioner modifier (minimum 1). This additional damage is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.

These liners do not occupy an item slot, but wearing more than one has no additional effect. Because they are not true magic items but rather science and geometry applied in a way that interferes with divination magic, these liners are somewhat fragile, and they cease to function after they have forced casters to attempt a caster level check or MSB check a number of times equal to the scholar&#8217;s Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), as determined at the time the liner was crafted.

Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the conscript&#8217;s secret.</p>\n<p>Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user&#8217;s appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities.</p>\n<p>Despite being a single person, the conscript&#8217;s dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity&#8217;s alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements.</p>\n<p>A conscript&#8217;s two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a conscript with a lawful neutral social identity could have a secret identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a conscript is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.</p>\n<p>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the conscript work only if the conscript is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual). Otherwise, the spell or effect has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist.</p>\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":"","long":null},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"featType":"classFeat","associations":{"classes":[["Conscript"]]},"showInQuickbar":false,"nonlethal":false,"abilityType":"ex","crOffset":"","attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}

{"_id":"uGq7o5CQaaAhkbuB","name":"Scholarâ€™s Knack","permission":{"default":0,"55oRMeK8J5d3pvei":3},"type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>At 2nd level and at every two levels thereafter, the scholar gains a scholar&#8217;s knack from the below list. Unless otherwise noted, all scholar&#8217;s knacks are extraordinary abilities.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc7\"><span>Academic Knowledge</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar adds half her class level (minimum 1) on all Knowledge skill checks and may make all Knowledge skill checks untrained. If the scholar succeeds on a Knowledge check to identify a creature that she has successfully scouted, she may spend a move action to instruct her allies on how best to take it down, granting them a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to the DCs of any abilities used against the creature for 1 minute.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc8\"><span>Aeronautics</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar has learned how to construct a basic gliding apparatus that can be quickly assembled and disassembled for easy use. It takes the scholar 1 hour to assemble the glider, and it has a number of hit points equal to the scholar&#8217;s class level, hardness equal to twice her Intelligence bonus (minimum 2), and weighs 10 lbs. The scholar may attach the glider to her or an ally&#8217;s pack or clothing as a standard action; while it is attached, the character can make a DC 15 Fly check to fall safely from any height without taking falling damage. When falling safely, they may make an additional DC 15 Fly check to glide, moving 5 ft. laterally for every 10 ft. they fall. Allies may use a glider in this manner once for a maximum number of rounds equal to 1 + the scholar&#8217;s Intelligence modifier before it breaks, and the scholar can use the glider in this way a total number of times per day equal to her Intelligence bonus (minimum 1) for the same duration; any attempt to exceed this usage results in failure and causes the glider to break, forcing the scholar to spend an hour building a new one before it can be used again. Only one glider can be attached to a single creature at a time.</p>\n<p>At 6th level, the scholar and any ally given a glider are able to fly with a speed of 30 ft. and average maneuverability. The duration that the glider lasts during a single use increases to a number of minutes equal to 1 + the scholar&#8217;s Intelligence bonus. In addition to using the glider to fall safely, the scholar can use the glider to fly a total number of times per day equal to 1 + her Intelligence bonus; any attempt to exceed this usage or remain in flight after the glider&#8217;s normal duration resulsts in failure and causes the glider to break, forcing the scholar to build a new one before it can be used again. Allies using a glider still suffer breakage after the first usage.</p>\n<p>If the scholar is at least 10th level, her gliders instead grant a fly speed of 60 ft. with good maneuverability, and may now stay aloft during a single use for a number of hours equal to 1/2 the scholar&#8217;s class level (rounded down).</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc9\"><span><span style=\"color: #00c000\">Amateur Arcanist [CS]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The scholar gains the Basic Magical Training and Advanced Magical Training feats, using her Intelligence modifier as her casting ability modifier.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc10\"><span>Animal Training, Large</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar&#8217;s familiar takes the form of an animal companion of her choice, using her scholar level as her effective druid level. The animal retains the special abilities and the Intelligence score of the scholar&#8217;s familiar, but also has the statistics and abilities of an animal companion. If the animal is dismissed, is lost, or dies, it can be replaced in the same way as a normal familiar can be.</p>\n<p>The scholar must have the small animal training knack to select this knack.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc11\"><span>Animal Training, Small</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar gains a familiar, treating her class level as her arcane spellcaster level. The scholar is unable to utilize the share spells, deliver touch spells, or scry on familiar abilities normally granted to a familiar, but is still considered to have them for the purposes of determining what archetypes her familiar qualifies for. If a familiar is dismissed, lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 week later through a specialized ritual that costs 200 gp per scholar level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc12\"><span><span style=\"color: #00c000\">Arcane Studies [CS]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The scholar furthers her magical studies. Each time the scholar takes this knack, she gains three bonus magic talents; these bonus talents may spent on any talent she qualifies for, or to gain one or more new base magic spheres. The scholar may take this knack up to a total of three times. The scholar must have the amateur arcanist knack to select this knack.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc13\"><span>Astrology</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar has learned to divine helpful information from the positions of the stars and planets. Once per day, the scholar may spend one hour studying star charts, the position of the celestial bodies, and other relevant astrological data to gain important insights into the day&#8217;s challenges, granting a pool of insight points equal to half the scholar&#8217;s class level (minimum 1) plus her Intelligence bonus. The scholar may spend a point from this pool as part of an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check to add 1d4+1 to the result; the scholar may spend a point to grant this bonus to an ally, but must spend an immediate action to do so.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc14\"><span><span style=\"color: #00c000\">Breakthrough Historian</span> [BaP/CS]</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar furthers their ability to teach the past and predict the future. The scholar gains the <a href=\"/divination\">Divination</a> sphere as a bonus talent. If the scholar possesses a drawback which removes the divine ability, she must buy back that drawback with this bonus talent. In addition, the scholar gains one (divine) talent as a bonus talent and Scholar Of Past And Future as a bonus feat. The scholar must have the amateur arcanist knack to select this knack.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc15\"><span><span style=\"color: #00c000\">Chronomancy, Amateur</span> [CS]</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar creates a small mechanical timepiece, similar to a holy symbol, that grants the <a href=\"/time\">Time</a> sphere, a spell pool equal to 1 + her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), uses Intelligence as her casting ability modifier, and treats her caster level as being equal to 1/2 her class level when using the Time sphere for as long as the timepiece is in her possession; this stacks normally with caster levels gained from other sources. If this is the scholar&#8217;s first time gaining a magic talent from any source, this is treated as the casting class feature and grants the scholar two bonus talents as normal, these talents must be used to gain talents in the Time sphere. The scholar loses these benefits if she loses possession of the timepiece; if the timepiece is lost or stolen, the scholar may assemble a new one during an 8 hour rest. Only the scholar may use this timepiece, and it does not provide any benefit to anyone other than the scholar.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc16\"><span><span style=\"color: #00c000\">Chronomancy</span> [CS]</span></h4>\n<p>As long as she has possession of the timepiece created with the amateur chronomancy talent, the scholar gains three additional talents from the Time sphere and is considered a Mid-Caster when determining her caster level with the Time sphere. In addition, her spell pool is now equal to 1/2 her class level + her Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>The scholar must have the amateur chronomancy knack to take this knack.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc17\"><span><span style=\"color: #00c000\">Chronomancy, Advanced</span> [CS]</span></h4>\n<p>As long as she has possession of the timepiece created with the amateur chronomancy talent, the scholar gains three additional talents from the Time sphere and treats her class level as her caster level with the Time sphere; this stacks normally with caster levels gained from other sources. In addition, her spell pool is now equal to her class level + her Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>The scholar must have the amateur chronomancy and chronomancy knacks to take this knack.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc18\"><span><span style=\"color: #00c000\">Crafting Genius</span> [CS]</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar gains one of the following crafting feats: Brew Potion, Craft Rod, Craft Staff, Craft Wand, Craft Wondrous Item, or Forge Ring. The scholar uses her class level as her caster level but must otherwise meet the prerequisites of the chosen feat (so a 4th level scholar could take Brew Potion or Craft Wondrous Item with this knack, but not take Craft Rod until she was at least 9th level).</p>\n<p>In addition, the scholar gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her class level on all skill checks made as part of the crafting process, and can bypass the normal restrictions for spell prerequisites on potions, spell trigger, and spell completion items by adding 3 + the level of the prerequisite spell (or 3 + 1/2 the caster level of the ability to be added if using a magic sphere effect) to the crafting DC. The scholar always treats her class levels as caster levels when determining the effects of items she crafts herself.</p>\n<p>This knack may be taken multiple times, granting an additional feat from the above list each time but providing no further benefits.</p>\n<p>The scholar must have the amateur arcanist knack to take this knack.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc19\"><span>Cunning Socialite</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar learns to leverage her keen insight to her advantage in social settings. Whenever the scholar has successfully used the scout ability to identify a creature&#8217;s weaknesses, she gains an insight bonus equal to 1/2 her class level on all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks made against the target, as well as to Intimidate checks made to improve the creature&#8217;s attitude towards the scholar.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc20\"><span>Cunning Attacker</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar&#8217;s preference for brains over brawn translates into an ability to plan attacks her opponent cannot easily counter. Whenever the scholar has successfully used the scout ability to identify a creature&#8217;s weaknesses, she may use her Intelligence bonus in place of her Strength modifier for melee attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, and in place of her Dexterity modifier with ranged attack rolls against the target. In addition, the scholar also gains a +1 insight bonus on all attack rolls made while using her Intelligence bonus to hit, plus an additional +1 at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc21\"><span>Experimental Evolution</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar performs various experiments with breeding, chemical modification, or other techniques to create powerful and unusual creatures loyal to her. When the scholar learns this knack, a familiar, animal companion, or mount she possesses gains a pool of evolution points equal to 1 + 1 per 4 class levels she possesses that can be used to give the creature evolutions as though it were an eidolon. If the scholar possesses multiple familiars, mounts, or companions, she may divide these evolution points amongst them however she chooses. Once a creature has spent its evolution points on a given evolution, the choice cannot be changed until the next time the scholar gains a class level. If the scholar&#8217;s companion creature dies or is otherwise permanently lost, she regains any evolution points spent on it and may apply them to a new creature after 1 week of training and experimentation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc22\"><span>Expert Healing</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar adds half her class level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Heal checks. Whenever a creature regains hit points due to the scholar&#8217;s use of the Heal skill (including her medical training class feature), or from an alchemical item the scholar has prepared (such as the salve formulae from the Alchemy sphere), any healing in excess of their normal maximum hit point total is applied as temporary hit points which last for 1 hour per class level the scholar possesses.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc23\"><span>Genetic Modification</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar gains Evolved Familiar and Improved Familiar as bonus feats, even if she would not otherwise qualify for them. The scholar uses her class level in place of her arcane caster level when determining what improved familiars she qualifies for. If the scholar has the large animal training knack, she may add the bonuses for level normally gained by her animal companion (bonus HD, feats, Strength and Dexterity bonuses, skill points, tricks, etc.) to her improved familiar, subtracting the familiar&#8217;s base form&#8217;s CR from her effective druid level when determining its advancement. Regardless of the improved familiar&#8217;s type, bonuses gained from progressing as an animal companion, such as bonus HD, use the normal advancement rules presented in the animal companion base statistics table. The scholar must have the small animal training knack to select this knack.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc24\"><span>Lightning Rod</span></h4>\n<p>Scholars with this knack gain a masterwork quarterstaff specially modified with mechanical and alchemical attachments that allow them to channel, store, and redirect electrical energy. This quarterstaff can be enchanted as a standard weapon of its type. If it is ever broken or destroyed, the scholar cannot use the abilities granted by this knack (or the improved lightning rod knack) until she spends 8 hours modifying another quarterstaff of at least masterwork quality. The scholar can spend an immediate action whenever she would be damaged by an attack dealing electricity damage to negate an amount of electricity damage up to 5 x her class level. In addition, the scholar can spend a full-round action while wielding her lightning rod quarterstaff to create a small localized storm that creates a bolt of lightning targeting one enemy within 60 ft. of the scholar and dealing 1d6 per class level electricity damage (Reflex halves, DC 10 + 1/2 scholar&#8217;s class level + her Intelligence modifier). The scholar can maintain this effect each round as a standard action, generating a new bolt of lightning each time she does so.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc25\"><span>Lightning Rod, Improved</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar&#8217;s understanding of atmospheric phenomenon and ability to control and manipulate atmospheric conditions with her lightning rod quarterstaff reaches new heights. The scholar can spend a standard action while carrying or wielding her quarterstaff to raise or lower the temperature within 30 ft. around herself by up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit per class level, simultaneously granting herself and any allies within the affected area fire resistance (if she increases the temperature) or cold resistance (if she lowers the temperature) equal to her class level. The scholar and any allies granted resistance by this ability are also immune to nonlethal damage due to exposure to extreme temperatures. In addition, the scholar can spend 1 minute focusing on nothing but activating her lightning rod to change the weather in the local area over a 1 mile radius centered on her. She can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area she is in, and can also use this ability to cause the weather in the area to become calm and normal for the season.</p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Season</th>\n<th>Possible Weather</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spring</td>\n<td>Tornado, thunderstorm, sleet storm, or hot weather</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Summer</td>\n<td>Torrential rain, heat wave, or hailstorm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Autumn</td>\n<td>Hot or cold weather, fog, or sleet</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Winter</td>\n<td>Frigid cold, blizzard, or thaw</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Late Winter</td>\n<td>Hurricane-force winds or early spring</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>The scholar can control the general tendencies of the weather, such as the direction and intensity of the wind. She cannot control specific applications of the weather&#8212;where lightning strikes, for example, or the exact path of a tornado. The weather continues as the scholar left it for up to one hour, or until she uses this ability to designate a new kind of weather (which fully manifests itself 10 minutes later). Contradictory conditions are not possible simultaneously. The scholar must have the lightning rod knack to select this knack.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc26\"><span>Liquefying Injections</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar may deliver one poison she has prepared or knows an Alchemy talent for as a melee touch attack; this poison is treated as being a contact poison even if it normally would not be. In addition to the poison&#8217;s normal effects, targets who fail their saving throw begin to liquefy.</p>\n<p>The first time a target fails a saving throw from a poison delivered by this ability, they take a -5 penalty to their natural armor (minimum 0) for 24 hours. The second time a target fails a saving throw against a poison delivered by this ability, they take 5 points of Dexterity and Strength damage. The third time a target fails a save against a poison delivered by this ability, they are permanently transformed into an ochre jelly, gaining the alignment, special abilities, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of its new form in place of its own and losing all class abilities, racial abilities, and other class or level benefits. Multiple instances of this ability throughout the day stack, though any ability that would cure the initial poison also removes all effects of this ability except for the final transformation. Creatures transformed into an ochre jelly revert to their original form upon death, but can otherwise only be restored to their original form via a miracle, wish, or similar effect. This is a polymorph effect.</p>\n<p>Scholars must be at least 6th level to select this knack.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc27\"><span>Martial Study</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar chooses a single combat sphere she possesses; she may use her class level in place of her base attack bonus when determining her bonus to hit, combat maneuver bonus, combat maneuver defense, ability DCs, and all other functions of the sphere normally determined by her base attack bonus when using talents or abilities granted by that sphere. The scholar may take this knack multiple times, choosing a different combat sphere each time. The scholar may not select the Equipment sphere with this knack.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc28\"><span>Nautical Exploration</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar has learned how to construct a basic nautical apparatus that can be quickly assembled and disassembled for easy use. It takes the scholar 1 hour to assemble or disassemble the nautical apparatus, and it has a number of hit points equal to the scholar&#8217;s class level and hardness equal to twice her Intelligence bonus (minimum 2), and weighs a total of 40 lbs. The nautical apparatus is capable of transporting up to 2 + the scholar&#8217;s Intelligence bonus Medium creatures underwater with a swim speed of 60 ft., and contains enough air to allow up to the maximum number of passengers to breathe for 1 hour per class level. Small creatures take up half the space and air of a Medium creature, while Large creatures take up twice the amount of space and air.</p>\n<p>Scholars of 7th level or higher can treat the gadget with special materials, allowing it to be used safely in virtually any liquid, including harmful substances like acid or lava. Creatures inside the gadget are protected from the effects of exposure to such materials as long as they remain inside. Opening or sealing the nautical apparatus requires a move action. Only the scholar can pilot this gadget; if anyone else attempts to pilot it, it requires a DC 15 Intelligence or Profession (sailor) check each round; failure means the gadget does not move in a desired direction and instead sinks 10 ft., or the distance to the first surface capable of sustaining its weight, whichever is closer. In addition, the gadget takes 1 point of damage each round someone other than the scholar who created it attempts to pilot it due to the fragile nature of some of the control mechanisms.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc29\"><span>Poisoncraft</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar has trained and studied in the arts of preparing and handling poisons. The scholar never risks accidentally poisoning herself when applying poison to a weapon or trap, and may apply poison to a weapon or trap as a move action. If the scholar is at least 6th level, she also adds 1/2 her class level to the DC of any non-Alchemy sphere poison she prepares herself, and she may now apply poisons to her weapons and traps as a swift action.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc30\"><span>Rapid Alchemy</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar&#8217;s research has taught her speedy and efficient techniques for creating various alchemical items. The scholar may craft any single alchemical item worth 150 gp or less (such as a vial of alchemist&#8217;s fire, smokestick, or tanglefoot bag) in half an hour; she must still succeed at a Craft (alchemy) check and pay all material costs as normal. The scholar cannot decrease this time any further by increasing the Craft DC. If the scholar knows the formulae for an improved version of an alchemical item worth 150 gp or less (such as the improved alchemist&#8217;s fire formulae) she reduces the crafting time to 15 minutes instead of half an hour. In addition, the scholar adds her Intelligence modifier to the DC of any alchemical item she crafts herself (this does not include improved alchemical items made with the Alchemy sphere).</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc31\"><span><span style=\"color: #00c000\">Ritual Crafter [CS]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The scholar gains the Craft Rituals feat even if she does not qualify for it and may use her class level in place of her caster level when researching rituals. The scholar may research rituals even if she does not possess the required spheres. This stacks normally with caster levels gained from other sources. The scholar must have the ritual student knack to select this knack.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc32\"><span><span style=\"color: #00c000\">Ritual Student [CS]</span></span></h4>\n<p>The scholar gains the Ritual Caster feat even if she does not qualify for it and may use her class level in place of her caster level when performing rituals. This stacks normally with caster levels gained from other sources. In settings where rituals are tied to specific traditions, the scholar chooses a number of traditions equal to her practitioner modifier and counts as possessing those traditions for the purposes of performing rituals.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc33\"><span>Studied Technique</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar formulates and masters a unique combat style or technique she can use to defeat her foes. Each time the scholar takes this knack, she gains three bonus talents; these bonus talents may be spent on any talent she qualifies for, or to gain one or more new base combat spheres. The scholar may take this knack up to a total of three times.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc34\"><span>Survival Training</span></h4>\n<p>The scholar may move through any sort of nonmagical undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. If the scholar is at least 6th level, this extends to areas of thorns and other natural impediments that have been magically manipulated to impede motion. In addition, the scholar leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc35\"><span>Trick Arrows</span></h4>\n<p>Scholars with this knack learn how to affix their flashbangs to bolts or arrowheads. As part of an attack action made with a ranged weapon, the scholar can affix a flashbang to her weapon, causing any creature struck by it to be treated as though it had also been struck by one of the scholar&#8217;s flashbangs. Flashbangs whose effects would affect an area larger than a single target treat the target of the scholar&#8217;s attack as the center of their effect.</p>\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":"","long":null},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":"","attackNotes":"","soundEffect":"","changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"featType":"classFeat","associations":{"classes":[["Scholar"]]},"showInQuickbar":false,"nonlethal":false,"abilityType":"ex","crOffset":"","attack":{"parts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","effects":[]}
