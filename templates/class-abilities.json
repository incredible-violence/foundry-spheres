This works for melee weapons, ranged weapons, and unarmed attacks. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to her casting ability modifier.</p><h4><span>Aura of Chaos [WM]</span></h4><p>As a swift action, you may spend a spell point to emit an aura out to 20 ft. that increases the wild magic chance of all effects originating from hostile creatures by 50% for a number of rounds equal to your casting ability modifier. Affected creatures are unaware of this penalty.</p><h4><span>Banishing Strike (Su)</span></h4><p>Whenever the mageknight strikes an extraplanar creature with a weapon attack, she may spend a spell point as an immediate action to attempt to break the bonds that bind it to this plane. The extraplanar creature must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 her mageknight level + casting ability modifier) or be sent back to its home plane. On a successful save the creature is still staggered for 1d4 rounds. The banished creature can be resummoned as normal.</p><h4><span>Black Dog Companion (requires mageknight 4, 1 talent with the curse descriptor)</span></h4><p>The mageknight gains an animal companion, treating her mageknight level -3 as her effective druid level. This stacks normally with other druid levels.</p><p>Additionally, the mageknight may take a lesser cù-sìth as their companion. This functions as a wolf animal companion, except that it has an Intelligence score of 10 and the mageknight may spend a spell point as an immediate action on her lesser cù-sìth’s turn to allow it to use its baleful howl special attack as a standard action, with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 its Hit Dice + her casting ability modifier.</p><p><strong>Baleful Howl (Su)</strong> As a standard action, the cù-sìth can release a howl of ill omen. All enemies within 60 feet take a -4 penalty to saves against curse and death effects and against the cù-sìth’s soul shepherd ability, as well as a -4 penalty to AC. These penalties last for 5 rounds. These penalties are reduced to -1 and last only a single round with a successful Will save. This is a sonic curse effect.</p><h4><span>Bleeding Wounds (Su)</span></h4><p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a swift action to inflict bleed damage equal to 1/2 her mageknight level (minimum 1) with every attack for a number of rounds equal to her casting ability modifier. Bleed damage does not stack.</p><h4><span>Bloodlust (Su)</span></h4><p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a swift action to increase her damage dealt to creatures depending on how many times she has hit them. For 1 round per level, whenever she successfully strikes an opponent with a weapon or natural attack, she gains a cumulative +1 bonus on future damage rolls, to a maximum equal to her class level. If she misses with an attack, the bonus to damage decreases by 1 (minimum 0).</p><h4><span>Breach Resistance (Su) [Alienist HB]</span></h4><p>Once per round, when you successfully hit a creature with an attack, you may reduce any spell resistance they possess by 1 for 1 minute per mageknight level. This penalty stacks with itself. At 10th level and every 10 levels thereafter, the spell resistance reduction on each attack increases by 1.</p><h4><span>Champion [CotS]</span></h4><p>The mageknight gains a Champion feat of her choice as a bonus feat (see Champion Feats</a>). She must meet the prerequisites of the feat. This mystic combat can be gained multiple times.</p><h4><span>Chivalry (requires resist magic, War sphere)</span></h4><p>Allies the mageknight shares a mandate with benefit from her resist magic class feature. She may spend a spell point to create a totem that allows allies to benefit from her resist magic class feature.</p><h4><span>Collapse Armor (Su)</span></h4><p>The mageknight can treat any armor she wears as having the collapsible special ability, except that she may collapse or recall the armor as a swift action instead of a full-round action, and she may choose which piece the armor collapses into each time she uses this ability. This allows the mageknight to wear multiple suits of armor and allows her to collapse one and recall another as part of the same action, though it does not allow her to benefit from more than one suit at a time. She may spend a spell point to collapse or recall her armor as a free action instead of a swift action.</p><h4><span>Combat Talent [CotS]</span></h4><p>You gain a bonus combat talent. This mystic combat may be taken more than once, granting an additional talent each time.</p><h4><span>Curse of Chaos [WM]</span></h4><p>As a swift action, you may spend a spell point to charge your next attack with disruptive energies. The next creature you deal damage to with a manufactured or natural weapon attack before the start of your next turn increases its wild magic chance by 100% for a number of rounds equal to your casting ability modifier. Affected creatures are unaware of this penalty.</p><h4><span>Elemental Defense (requires mystic defense)</span></h4><p>The mageknight’s mystic defense class feature also gives her resistance to acid, cold, electricity, and fire damage equal to the damage reduction mystic defense grants.</p><h4><span>Enchanted Touch (Su)</span></h4><p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a swift action to grant enhancement bonuses to all attacks she makes for 1 round per mageknight level. Her unarmed strikes, natural attacks, and wielded weapons gain a +1 enhancement bonus which does not stack with any enhancement bonus her weapons already possess. This bonus increases by +1 for every 5 mageknight levels she possesses, to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.</p><h4><span>Enhanced Physicality (Su)</span></h4><p>The mageknight may spend a spell point to reroll an Acrobatics, Climb, Fly, or Swim check she just made with a bonus to her roll equal to 1/2 her mageknight level (minimum 1). She must take the second roll, even if it is worse.</p><h4><span>Ensorcelled Defenses (Su)</span></h4><p>As a swift action, the mageknight may spend a spell point to charge her armor and shield with energy, partially transforming them into fields of force that protect her. For a number of minutes equal to her casting ability modifier, her armor and shield bonuses (and any enhancement bonuses they have) become force effects and apply to her touch AC.</p><h4><span>Form-Breaker (Su)</span></h4><p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a swift action to empower her next attack with magical energies disruptive to shapechangers. If the attack successfully strikes a creature under a polymorph effect (such as shapeshift, beast shape spells, polymorph, or change shape), she may attempt a magical skill check against the effect’s MSD. She gains a +4 bonus on this check. If successful, the polymorph effect immediately ends and the target cannot benefit from polymorph effects for a number of rounds equal to her CAM.</p><h4><span>Graft Weapon (Su)</span></h4><p>The mageknight may spend 1 minute to graft a weapon to one of her limbs capable of wielding a weapon as per the Graft Weapon trait of the Morphic Weapon Alteration talent. This graft persists until the weapon is removed as a standard action.</p><h4><span>Great Fall</span></h4><p>When falling, the mageknight treats the distance fallen as being 10 feet shorter per mageknight level when determining the amount of damage she sustains. At 20th level, she may fall any distance without taking damage.</p><h4><span>Greater Combatant</span></h4><p>The mageknight gains a combat or champion feat. She must meet the prerequisites of the feat. This mystic combat may be taken multiple times. Each time, it grants the mageknight a new combat or champion feat.</p><h4><span>High Jump</span></h4><p>The mageknight may add her level to all Acrobatics checks made to jump, both for vertical jumps and horizontal jumps. In addition, she always counts as having a running start when attempting jump checks using Acrobatics. By spending 1 spell point as a swift action, she may gain a +20 bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump for 1 round.</p><h4><span>Honed Shadowblade (requires shadowblade)</span></h4><p>Objects created with the mageknight’s Shadowstuff Armament feat act as if she had the Surreinforcement feat. Treat her mageknight level as Illusion caster level for calculating its effects for her shadowstuff armaments. This stacks normally with caster levels gained from other sources. Once per round as a free action she may cause a creature damaged by one of her weapons created or enhanced by her shadowblade mystic combat to suffer a -1 circumstance penalty to all Perception checks and Will saves against illusions for one minute. This penalty stacks with itself up to 5 times.</p><h4><span>Hunter’s Mark (Su) (requires marked)</span></h4><p>The mageknight can sense any creature she has left a magical mark on using her marked ability. She always knows the direction and distance to them and what plane they are currently on.</p><p>As a full-round action she may spend a spell point to teleport herself to a square adjacent to a marked creature regardless of their distance from her, though she cannot travel between planes this way.</p><h4><span>Imbued Weapon (Su)</span></h4><p>As a swift action, the mageknight may spend a spell point to charge a weapon she is holding with magical energy for a number of minutes equal to her casting ability modifier. While the weapon is charged, the mageknight may add her casting ability modifier instead of her Dexterity or Strength modifier to attack rolls and damage rolls with this weapon.</p><p>If the weapon is a melee weapon, she may use the weapon as a thrown weapon with an increment of 20 feet. The weapon keeps its own damage and critical hit characteristics, and is not considered an improvised weapon.</p><p>When an imbued weapon is used as a thrown weapon, the weapon teleports back to her hand at the end of her turn, or the beginning of her next turn if used outside her turn. When an imbued weapon is a ranged weapon, then making ranged attacks with the weapon does not draw attacks of opportunity.</p><h4><span>Invisibility</span></h4><p>As a swift action, the mageknight may spend a spell point to gain the invisible condition for 1 round per mageknight level, or until she performs an offensive action against a foe.</p><h4><span>Karmic Invigoration (Su) (requires Life sphere, marked)</span></h4><p>As a swift action, the mageknight may infuse her marked target with an aura of positive energy. Until the end of her next turn, whenever an ally hits the target, she may invigorate the ally as a free action, even if they are not in range of her invigorate ability or if it is not her turn.</p><h4><span>Lingering Pain</span></h4><p>As an immediate action after successfully dealing damage to an opponent, the mageknight may spend a spell point to cause that damage to be considered continuous damage for the purpose of concentration checks made by the target prior to the beginning of the mageknight’s next turn.</p><h4><span>Magic Power</span></h4><p>The mageknight gains a magic talent for which she qualifies. This mystic combat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, she gains a new magic talent.</p><h4><span>Mage’s Charge</span></h4><p>When making a charge, the mageknight may spend a spell point as a free action to add her mageknight level as a bonus to her first attack roll and damage roll. This damage is considered precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit or by similar effects, such as a lance or the Spirited Charge feat.</p><h4><span>Mark of Pain (requires marked)</span></h4><p>Whenever the mageknight marks a target, she may also spend a spell point to lower their damage reduction and energy resistance against her attacks by her mageknight level. This condition lasts as long as the mark does.</p><h4><span>Martial Tactics (Ex)</span></h4><p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a swift action to gain the benefits of one teamwork feat. She must meet all the feat’s prerequisites. All of her allies are treated as if they possessed the same teamwork feat for the purpose of determining whether she receives a bonus from the teamwork feat acquired. Her allies do not receive any bonuses from these feats unless they actually possess the feats themselves.</p><p>Her allies’ positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for her to receive the listed bonus. She keeps the feat for a number of minutes equal to her casting ability modifier, or until she spends another spell point to acquire another feat.</p><h4><span>Mounted Combatant</span></h4><p>When using any mystic combat ability, the mageknight may spend an additional spell point to extend the benefit of that ability to her mount as well.</p><h4><span>Mystic Adaptation</span></h4><p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a swift action to gain the benefits of one combat feat of her choice for a number of minutes equal to her casting ability modifier.</p><p>She must meet all of this feat’s prerequisites. At 7th level, she may gain the benefits of two combat feats of her choice whenever she uses this ability, and one may be used to meet the prerequisites of the other. At 14th level, she gains the benefits of three combat feats of her choice. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack, only the most recent use applies. If a combat feat has a limited number of daily uses (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability counts towards that feat’s daily limit.</p><h4><span>Mystic Maneuver</span></h4><p>The mageknight may spend a spell point to perform any combat maneuver as a swift action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, with a bonus to her CMB equal to 1/2 her mageknight level (minimum 1).</p><h4><span>Mystic Celerity</span></h4><p>Once per round, when using any ability gained through the mystic combat class feature, the mageknight may spend an extra spell point to decrease that ability’s required action by one step: standard actions become move actions, swift actions become free actions, etc. This cannot reduce an immediate action.</p><h4><span>Mystic Command [Gen. HB]</span></h4><p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a swift action to share one teamwork feat she possesses with all allied creatures within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 class levels) for 1 minute per level or until she uses this ability again.</p><h4><span>Mystic Might</span></h4><p>As a swift action, the mageknight may spend a spell point to increase her size category to Large for a number of minutes equal to her casting ability modifier, as if using the Size Change Alteration talent.</p><h4><span>Mystic Reaping (requires mageknight 6) [Gravecaller's HB]</span></h4><p>The knight’s blade drinks in magic as it does life. Whenever the mageknight reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points, she gains 2 temporary spell points which last for 1 minute (see the Mana sphere for rules on temporary spell points). Creatures with fewer Hit Dice than half the mageknight’s character level do not grant temporary spell points.</p><p>If the mageknight possesses the resist magic class feature, the bonus from her resist magic ability applies to all death and negative energy effects, even if they are not spells, spell-like abilities, or magic sphere effects.</p><h4><span>Penetrating Blow</span></h4><p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a swift action to cause all her attacks to be resolved as touch attacks until the end of her turn.</p><h4><span>Quickened Reflexes</span></h4><p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a swift action to gain a dodge bonus to AC equal to half her mageknight level (minimum 1) for a number of rounds equal to her casting ability modifier.</p><h4><span>Raging Combatant</span></h4><p>As a swift action, the mageknight may spend a spell point to enter a rage for 1 round per mageknight level. This is similar to a barbarian’s rage, granting a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +2 morale bonus to Will saves, and suffering a -2 penalty to AC. She is under the same restrictions with skills, spells, and sphere abilities as a barbarian, but she may use mystic combat abilities as normal. She is fatigued afterward as a barbarian. She may end a rage prematurely as a free action.</p><h4><span>Relentless Pursuit (requires marked)</span></h4><p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a swift action to make a single weapon attack against an enemy she has marked. This attack is made at her highest base attack bonus, and receives a circumstance bonus to damage equal to her mageknight level.</p><h4><span>Resilience of Soul</span></h4><p>As an immediate action, the mageknight may spend a spell point to reroll a saving throw she just failed. She must take the second result, even if it is worse.</p><h4><span>Ritual Tracker (Su)</span></h4><p>The mageknight can track creatures by observing the omens and mystic signs that subtly mark their passing. She can use Spellcraft instead of Survival to both find and follow tracks, using the same DCs listed under the Survival skill. In addition, she can track creatures that leave no tracks, such as flying and swimming creatures, and creatures using trackless step or pass without trace, taking a -5 penalty to her check for each such effect they benefit from. Finally, if she finds or follows tracks where someone has teleported or moved between planes, she may attempt a Spellcraft or Survival check against a DC equal to their MSD to determine their destination.</p><p>With a successful check she learns the direction of their destination and whether the distance to that destination is near (less than 1 mile), moderate (1 mile to 10 miles) or far (greater than 10 miles); if they moved between planes she instead learns what plane they moved to.</p><h4><span>Self-Reliance (Ex) (requires Life sphere)</span></h4><p>Whenever the mageknight invigorates or cures herself with the Life sphere, she may use her class level as her caster level. This stacks normally with caster levels gained from other sources.</p><h4><span>Shadowblade</span></h4><p>The mageknight gains the Shadowstuff Armament feat. Additionally, she may spend a spell point as a free action to add the shadow wake special ability to a weapon for 1 round per mageknight level.</p><h4><span>Shared Marking (requires marked, War sphere)</span></h4><p>When the mageknight marks a target, allies she shares a mandate with gain the same static benefits from the mark that she does. This does not give her ally abilities that trigger from her mark, such as relentless pursuit.</p><h4><span>Shifted Karma (Su) (requires marked)</span></h4><p>Whenever the mageknight hits an enemy she has marked with a melee weapon or natural weapon, she may give the target a -4 penalty to attack and AC against creatures other than herself. This penalty lasts until the beginning of her next turn, or she may spend a spell point to make it last for 1 minute. This ability ends immediately if the mark ends, or if the target successfully hits her with a melee attack.</p><h4><span>Shining Armor (Su)</span></h4><p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a swift action to cause her armor to give off a slight glow as it becomes partially translucent. While in this state, she takes no armor check penalties for wearing the armor, nor does she take any penalties to her speed from wearing armor, and her Dexterity bonus to AC is unlimited. This lasts a number of minutes equal to her casting ability modifier.</p><h4><span>Signature Scar (Su)</span></h4><p>When the mageknight damages an enemy with a melee weapon or natural weapon, she may spend a spell point as a free action to give them a scar. The target may attempt a Fortitude save against a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 her mageknight level plus her casting ability modifier to avoid the scar. Any hit points regained by a scarred enemy are instead diverted to the mageknight unless she is already at her full hit point total. The scar fades away after 1 minute.</p><h4><span>Spell Mirror (requires mageknight 10, spell shield) [WM]</span></h4><p>When a spell or sphere effect that has the mageknight as a target is negated by her spell shield, the effect is turned back upon its caster as if the caster was the original target. Use her own attack modifiers if an attack roll is required.</p><h4><span>Spell Shield [WM]</span></h4><p>As an immediate action, the mageknight may spend a spell point to grant herself spell resistance equal to 15 + her mageknight level until the start of her next turn.</p><h4><span>Strategic Planning (requires War sphere)</span></h4><p>At the beginning of the day, choose a (mandate) talent or (totem) talent the mageknight qualifies for. She gains that mandate or totem talent for the duration of the day. At any time during the day, she may change her choice by meditating for 10 minutes.</p><h4><span>Sunder The Veil</span></h4><p>The mageknight gains the Pierce The Veil feat. She needs not meet its prerequisites. Additionally, she may spend a spell point as a free action to add the skeptical weapon enhancement to a weapon for 1 round per mageknight level.</p><h4><span>Sustain</span></h4><p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as an immediate action to grant herself temporary hit points equal to twice her mageknight level + her casting ability modifier that lasts 1 minute. This can keep her from dying.</p><h4><span>Swift Combatant</span></h4><p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a free action to move up to 30 feet. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.</p><h4><span>Unbreakable</span></h4><p>The mageknight may spend a spell point as a swift action to grant herself DR/- equal to her mageknight level for a number of rounds equal to her casting ability modifier.</p><h4><span>Veil Piercer (Su)</span></h4><p>The mageknight’s magic allows her to interact with other dimensions. She may choose to touch and interact with ethereal and incorporeal creatures and objects as if they were solid. She may choose to have her attacks and effects count as magical for the purpose of affecting incorporeal creatures. If she does, her damage is not halved against them, and effects that do not cause damage are not subject to the standard 50% chance of failure. In addition, she may inflict critical hits and precision damage on incorporeal creatures as if using a ghost touch weapon. This does not allow her to automatically perceive anything ethereal or invisible.</p><h4><span>Vengeful</span></h4><p>If a creature strikes the mageknight and is within her threatened area, she may spend a spell point as an immediate action to make a single attack against that creature at her highest base attack bonus.</p><h4><span>Ward Against Magic (Sp) (requires Protection sphere, resist magic)</span></h4><p>The mageknight may create a ward that duplicates the effects of her resist magic class feature for all within. She may also create an aegis that duplicates the effects of her resist magic class feature for any creature that bears it. The bonus from her resist magic ability can not stack with itself this way.</p><h4><span>Weirding Adept</span></h4><p>The mageknight gains the Mage Feint Illusion talent and the Weird Motion combat feat. She needs not meet their prerequisites if she possesses the weirding initiate mystic combat.
